//If you receive an integer, place it at the front of the list.If, however, you receive the command bang, remove the first element
// whose value is smaller than the average of the elements of the list, print "shot {element}" and then decrement every element in the list by 1.
//If you receive "bang" and there are no elements left in the list, print "nobody left to shoot! last one was {lastRemovedInt}" 
//and end the program. When you finally do receive the command "end", either print "survivors: {elements, separated by space}"
// if there are any, or "you shot them all. last one standing was {lastRemovedInt}".
